      <h1>Why this Opportunity</h1>
      <p>
        Investors are enthusiastic about Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT,
        OTCQB: PCRCF) and their Indonesian cobalt mining project because it is
        strategically located near the world’s largest user of cobalt: China.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chinese battery manufacturers want a ready supply of conflict-free
        cobalt and nickel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp.’s (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) project in Papua,
        Indonesia covers 5,000 Ha with 9 prospects, 5 of them drill-tested and
        with known cobalt-nickel deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Infrastructure to and around the project is excellent, allowing for
        year-round access, and a 45-minute drive on sealed roads from the
        airport and near a city with skilled labor ready to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cyclops project is adjacent a deep tidewater with a tremendous
        potential for easy port access and direct shipping routes to China.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shares of Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) continue to
        gain momentum as investors see Indonesia as potentially the world’s
        largest supplier of vital battery metals.

        Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) is entering Chapter

        battery metals sector an attractive entry point
      </h1>
    </div>
    <section class="indonesia">
      <h1>Why Indonesia?</h1>
      <p>Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers of nickel</p>
      <p>
        Cobalt is a by-product of nickel mining and modern mineral processing
        options may unlock the massive potential Indonesia holds for cobalt
        resources
      </p>
      <p>
        Indonesia is strategically located in the backyard of the world's
        largest battery market – China. This gives Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp.
        (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) a distinct advantage over cobalt explorers
        located in the West or in Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indonesia has begun to attract billions of dollars in investment from
        multi-national mining and technology firms and individual investors
        intent on securing future production rights and financial gains
      </p>
      <img src="images/Why Indo Image1.jpg" />
      <p>
        Indonesian Maritime Minister, Luhut Pandjaitan says Indonesia will
        “become the main player in lithium batteries” and that it will “control
        the world market” as developers begin construction of $4 billion EV
        battery project on Sulawesi, backed by a consortium of investors from
        China, Japan, and South Korea
      </p>
      <p>
        Pacific Rim Cobalt Corp. recognized this opportunity early and seized
        the moment by acquiring a large, advanced cobalt - nickel prospect
        located on tide water, with direct shipping routes to China.  Pacific
        Rim Cobalt Corp. (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) plans to systematically
        unlock the potentially significant value this mineralized asset may
        hold.

      <h1>Why is China Important?</h1>
      <p>
        China is the No.1 user of Cobalt and their demand is growing China is
        pushing for an aggressive California-style Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV)
        program that requires 12% of all cars sold in China to be EVs by 2020
        Given a 1% EV adoption rate in China today, that target translates to a
        12x increase in the number of electric cars sold in China by end of the
        decade Cobalt is now rated a “strategically important metal” meaning the
        US government can arbitrarily create shortages

        In July 2018, Pacific Rim Cobalt (CSE: BOLT, OTCQB: PCRCF) entered into

        "We are excited and optimistic about the unique possibility of
        developing this project into an asset that will add shareholder value
